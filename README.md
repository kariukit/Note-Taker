# Note-Taker

The challenge in this project was to create an application called Note Taker that can be used to write and save notes. This application will use an Express.js back end and will save and retrieve note data from a JSON file.

The application’s front end had already been created. The challenge was job to build the back end, connect the two, and then deploy the entire application to Heroku.


# 1) The user story for the project was:

AS A small business owner

I WANT to be able to write and save notes

SO THAT I can organize my thoughts and keep track of tasks I need to complete


# 2) The acceptance criteria for the project was:

GIVEN a note-taking application

WHEN I open the Note Taker

THEN I am presented with a landing page with a link to a notes page

WHEN I click on the link to the notes page

THEN I am presented with a page with existing notes listed in the left-hand column, plus empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column

WHEN I enter a new note title and the note’s text

THEN a Save icon appears in the navigation at the top of the page

WHEN I click on the Save icon

THEN the new note I have entered is saved and appears in the left-hand column with the other existing notes

WHEN I click on an existing note in the list in the left-hand column

THEN that note appears in the right-hand column

WHEN I click on the Write icon in the navigation at the top of the page

THEN I am presented with empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column
